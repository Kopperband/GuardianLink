## Synopsis:

GuardianLink is a web application built with Ruby on Rails designed to provide a free platform to connect NGOâ€™s and non-profit clients who require assistance in the cybersecurity realm with cybersecurity volunteers who have the skills and experience to assist. The primary goal of GuardianLink is to offer a user friendly and streamlined approach to connect these two groups together.

## Technology Stack and Rationale

### **Technology Stack**

- **Ruby on Rails:** Chosen for its ease of use with MVC.
- **Sqllite3:** Selected for its ease of use and integration with RoR.
- **Vanilla CSS**: Used for responsive design and customization.
- **Devise:** Utilized for user authentication due to its ease of integration and its plethora of features.

### Rationale

This tech stack was choses as it provides a highly flexible and scalable base application as the platform expands and allows for additional features to be added as knowledge and experience of the developer grows. Ruby on rails is ideal for quick development and deployment of a skeleton application with the Devise Gem for a solid user authentication base.  Sqllite3 offers a flexible and robust database solution for storage of user information. Vanilla CSS offers detailed customization of the user interface without overcrowding the HTML documents when troubleshooting errors.   

## Testing Methods

- Allowed a small group of users to interact with the system to look for bugs and broken items

## Challenges Faced

- The implementation of the sign out link caused issued as the link_to helper method I used did not work and would not act as I thought it would. After searching for a solution I was able to find success in changing it to a button_to as link_to is for a GET request and button_to is for POST

## Lessons Learned

- One of the biggest lessons i learned is to keep things simple. I originally designed this project with 3 user models (Admin, Volunteer and Non Profit) however I found it extremely difficult to try and integrate them together for specific tasks. so in the end I combined them all into on user model with a role attribute to classify their roles. I had issues removing the three user models from the original application so i ended up just restarting from scratch and transferring over the views that I had created.

## Future Recommendations

- Change colour scheme or layout. personally I find that the colour scheme and layout look somewhat like an insurance company landing page.
- Develop a private message feature allowing users to reach out to each other on the platform instead of sending emails that could be sent to spam folders.
- As there is no user credential proof a user reviews page of some kind to build credibility of users for others to see.
